# PORES Framework

## Overview

PORES Framework is a library that provides utilities and configurations for common functionalities in a Spring Boot application.

## Features

- **Elasticsearch Integration:** Easily connect to Elasticsearch with configurable properties.
- **Redis Cache Service:** Simplify caching using Redis with a provided cache service.
- **Configuration for Common Services:** Configure common services like Kafka, UUID generation, and more.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to integrate PORES Framework into your Spring Boot project.

### 1. Add Maven Dependency

Add the following dependency to your project's `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.pores</groupId>
    <artifactId>PORES-Framework</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Configure Elasticsearch

In your project, create a configuration file for Elasticsearch, e.g., `application.yml`:

```yaml
pores:
  framework:
    elasticsearch:
      host: localhost
      port: 9200
      # Add other Elasticsearch configuration properties
```

### 3. Configure Redis

Similarly, configure Redis in your `application.yml`:

```yaml
pores:
  framework:
    redis:
      host: localhost
      port: 6379
      # Add other Redis configuration properties
```

### 4. Use Framework Components

Now you can use the components provided by the PORES Framework in your project. Inject the configured `RestHighLevelClient` for Elasticsearch, and use the `CacheService` for Redis caching.

```java
// Example usage of Elasticsearch 
@Autowired
private EsUtilService esUtilService;

// Example usage of Redis 
@Autowired
private CacheService cacheService;
```

### 5. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
```markdown
- **Java:** Ensure you have Java (version 11) installed.
- **Spring Boot:** Ensure you have Spring Boot (version 2.7.16) installed.
- **Elasticsearch:** Ensure you have Elasticsearch (version 7.17.13) installed.
